# Node.js releases data

All data is located in `data` directory.

`data/processed` contains `envs.json` with node.js releases data preprocessed to be used by [Browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) and other projects. Each version in this file contains only necessary info: version, release date, LTS flag/name, and security flag.

`data/release-schedule` contains `release-schedule.json` with node.js releases date and end of life date.

## Installation
```bash
npm install node-releases
```
