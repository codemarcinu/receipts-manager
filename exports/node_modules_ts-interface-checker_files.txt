      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# ts-interface-checker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gristlabs/ts-interface-checker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gristlabs/ts-interface-checker)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ts-interface-checker.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ts-interface-checker)


> Runtime library to validate data against TypeScript interfaces.

This package is the runtime support for validators created by
[ts-interface-builder](https://github.com/gristlabs/ts-interface-builder).
It allows validating data, such as parsed JSON objects received
over the network, or parsed JSON or YAML files, to check if they satisfy a
TypeScript interface, and to produce informative error messages if they do not.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev ts-interface-builder
npm install --save ts-interface-checker
```

## Usage

Suppose you have a TypeScript file defining an interface:
```typescript
// foo.ts
interface Square {
  size: number;
  color?: string;
}
```

The first step is to generate some code for runtime checks:
```bash
`npm bin`/ts-interface-builder foo.ts
```

It produces a file like this:
```typescript
// foo-ti.js
import * as t from "ts-interface-checker";

export const Square = t.iface([], {
  "size": "number",
  "color": t.opt("string"),
});
...
```

Now at runtime, to check if a value satisfies the Square interface:
```typescript
import fooTI from "./foo-ti";
import {createCheckers} from "ts-interface-checker";

const {Square} = createCheckers(fooTI);

Square.check({size: 1});                  // OK
Square.check({size: 1, color: "green"});  // OK
Square.check({color: "green"});           // Fails with "value.size is missing"
Square.check({size: 4, color: 5});        // Fails with "value.color is not a string"
```

Note that `ts-interface-builder` is only needed for the build-time step, and
`ts-interface-checker` is needed at runtime. That's why the recommendation is to npm-install the
former using `--save-dev` flag and the latter using `--save`.

## Checking method calls

If you have an interface with methods, you can validate method call arguments and return values:
```typescript
// greet.ts
interface Greeter {
  greet(name: string): string;
}
```

After generating the runtime code, you can now check calls like:
```typescript
import greetTI from "./greet-ti";
import {createCheckers} from "ts-interface-checker";

const {Greeter} = createCheckers(greetTI);

Greeter.methodArgs("greet").check(["Bob"]);     // OK
Greeter.methodArgs("greet").check([17]);        // Fails with "value.name is not a string"
Greeter.methodArgs("greet").check([]);          // Fails with "value.name is missing"

Greeter.methodResult("greet").check("hello");   // OK
Greeter.methodResult("greet").check(null);      // Fails with "value is not a string"
```

## Type suites

If one type refers to a type defined in another file, you need to tell the interface checker about
all type names when you call `createCheckers()`. E.g. given

```typescript
// color.ts
export type Color = RGB | string;
export type RGB = [number, number, number];
```

```typescript
// shape.ts
import {Color} from "./color";
export interface Square {
  size: number;
  color?: Color;
}
```

the produced files `color-ti.ts` and `shape-ti.ts` do not automatically refer to each other, but
expect you to relate them in `createCheckers()` call:
```typescript
import color from "./color-ti";
import shape from "./shape-ti";
import {createCheckers} from "ts-interface-checker";

const {Square} = createCheckers(shape, color);    // Pass in all required type suites.

Square.check({size: 1, color: [255,255,255]});
```

## Strict checking

You may check that data contains no extra properties. Note that it is not generally recommended as
it this prevents backward compatibility: if you add new properties to an interface, then older
code with strict checks will not accept them.

Following on the example above:
```typescript
Square.strictCheck({size: 1, color: [255,255,255], bg: "blue"});    // Fails with value.bg is extraneous
Square.strictCheck({size: 1, color: [255,255,255,0.5]});            // Fails with ...value.color[3] is extraneous
```

## Type guards

Standard `Checker` objects do the type checking logic, but are unable to make the TypeScript
compiler aware that an object of `unknown` type implements a certain interface.

Basic code:
```typescript
const unk: unknown = {size: 1, color: "green"};
// Type is unknown, so TypeScript will not let you access the members.
console.log(unk.size); // Error: "Object is of type 'unknown'"
```

With a `Checker` available:
```typescript
import fooTI from "./foo-ti";
import {createCheckers} from "ts-interface-checker";

const {Square} = createCheckers(fooTI);

const unk: unknown = {size: 1, color: "green"};

if (Square.test(unk)) {
  // unk does implement Square, but TypeScript is not aware of it.
  console.log(unk.size); // Error: "Object is of type 'unknown'"
}
```

To enable type guard functionality on the existing `test`, and `strictTest` functions, `Checker`
objects should be cast to `CheckerT<>` using the appropriate type.

Using `CheckerT<>`:
```typescript
import {Square} from "./foo";
import fooTI from "./foo-ti";
import {createCheckers, CheckerT} from "ts-interface-checker";

const {Square} = createCheckers(fooTI) as {Square: CheckerT<Square>};

const unk: unknown = {size: 1, color: "green"};

if (Square.test(unk)) {
  // TypeScript is now aware that unk implements Square, and allows member access.
  console.log(unk.size);
}
```

## Type assertions

`CheckerT<>` will eventually support type assertions using the `check` and `strictCheck` functions,
however, this feature is not yet fully working in TypeScript.
